                          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned
                          were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I
                          honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                          “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve
                          been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who
                          had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
                          course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
                          thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling -
                          time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully
                          switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
                          startup. ”
